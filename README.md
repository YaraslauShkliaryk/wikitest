Some comments:

-I parametrized the added pages, so by changing the variables page1, page2 we could easily update the test;

-Varialbes and functions declaration ideally should be done as separate PageObjects, just makes not a lot of sense for this small scenario;

-Possibly there could be more asserts added, but from my first impression working with Cypress it does a lot of checks in the TestRunner by default.
